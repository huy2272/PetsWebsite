    <p>Feeding <br>
    We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet.
    Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat.
    Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health.
    The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten.
    Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.
    You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your catâ€™s water bowls daily.
    Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.
    Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well
    Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.
    Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.
    Please visit our People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets page for a list of off-limits items, as well as our Cat Nutrition Tips page for more information.</p><br>
